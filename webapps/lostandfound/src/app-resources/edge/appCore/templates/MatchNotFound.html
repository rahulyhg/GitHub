If you would like to secure your other belongings pro-actively, you may also try our 'Lost And Found ID' creation service. 

You just need to create a 'Lost and Found Id' and attach a visible note to any of your belongings which would say:

<b><i>In case you find me, please report it on http://lostandfound.report?found=YOUR_ID</i></b>

It is also a free service.

Good Luck In Your Search!
