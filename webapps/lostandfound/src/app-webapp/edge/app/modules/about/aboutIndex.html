					Why Lost And Found?
				</h1>

				<i><B>It is an effort towards making World Loss Free.</B></i><br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know losses are painful! We know how it feels when you lose something important, may it then be your folder with bunch of important documents, Passport, Pan Card or anything else.
				Even if such document has your address mentioned, it may not be recent one. In such cases it becomes almost difficult to get back such things, as there is absolutely no way to reach the person who finds your missing item.
				
				<br><br>
				
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very purpose of this site is to establish this very connection between the person who <B>lost and</B> person who <B>found</B> the item. We use our intelligent algorithm to find the probable matches between Lost Report and Found Report.
				
				<br><br>
				
				<i><B>It is Safe and Secure. </B></i><br><br>
				
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, information that we collect is <B>safe and secure</B>, so we assure you that none of the information will be misused or shared with any of the data service providers.
				
				<br><br>
				<i><B>It is Absolutely Free. </B></i><br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as to allow people to report the missing item, we have kept our service <B>absolutely free.</B>
				We would strive to our best to make sure that the world we live in becomes loss-free.

					How this works?
				</h1>

				<br>
				
				<i><B>Reporting Found Item:</B></i><br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who <B>finds</B> lost item visits our site and clicks on 'Found' tab and submits 'Found' Report. 
				S/he mentions details about the item found and also mentions email address and optionally Phone Number where owner (the person who lost an item)
				may reach him or her.
				<br><br>
				
				<i><B>Reporting Lost Item:</B></i><br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owner i.e. the person who <B>lost</B> item visits our site and clicks on 'Lost' tab and submits 'Lost' Report. 
				S/he mentions details about the item found and also mentions email address, Phone Number and address where the items needs to be couriered. 
				<br><br>
				
				<i><B>Matchmaking Algorithm:</B></i><br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Website would now try to find probable pairs between 'Lost' and 'Found' reports. 
				Once it finds perfect match, both the persons involved are sent an email in which details about the item and contact details is mentioned,
				thereby enabling these two people to communicate with each other. 
				<br><br>
				
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This match making becomes very easy when the document lost has <B>unique identifier</B> like Passport / Aadhar or PAN Card.
				There are very bright chances that system would find the match. But for other things such as <B>locked bag</B>, it is kind of difficult to find the matching reports, as there is <B>no unique id</B> by which 'Lost' report can be paired with 'Found' report.
				
				So as to address this issue, we offer a service called <B>'Lost and Found Tag' service. This is again Free service</B>.

					What is Lost and Found Tag?
				</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As said earlier, this is <font color="green">pro-active way of securing all your belongings.</font>
				
				Here you are supposed to create 'Lost And Found Id' by clicking on <B>'Tag' tab</B> and providing contact details. These contact details are secure and optional except email address.
				<br>
				Say the ID created is '12345'. Now you are just supposed to add a visible note to any of your belongings may be by using Ribbon, or empty Card and permanent marker which would say:
				
				<br><br>
				<B><I><font color="green">"In Case you find me, please report it on http://lostandfound.report/#/?found=12345"</font></I></B>
				<br><br>
				
				It will be then <B>very easy</B> for us to contact you when someone reports found item with above note.
				
				<br><br>
				
				In a case when lost item doesn't have both Unique Identifier or Lost And Found Tag, we ask couple of more questions and then TRY to find probable pair. But here, chances become very low to find the pair. 
				Still our intelligent algorithm would TRY best.
