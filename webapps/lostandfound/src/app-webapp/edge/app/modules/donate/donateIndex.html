			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you might have noticed, <B>all our services are absolutely free</B>. Though these services are free to you, they are not free to us. 
			We need funds to keep this site live, but to raise funds, we did not want to charge the needy. We wanted to keep it discretionary and not obligatory to pay for the charges. 
			So if you like the service and you think we deserve to survive, please think to 'Donate Us'. <i>Donations as low as 10 Rs. would also help us greatly, and we would be thankful to you for the same.</i>

			We would want to be able to help non profit organizations (NGOs) as well.
