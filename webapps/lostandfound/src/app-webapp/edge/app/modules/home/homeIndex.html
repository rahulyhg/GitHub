			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we please request you to submit a 'Found' report here? This is absolutely a free service. 
			You would not loose anything but definitely would get <B>'Blessings'</B> from us and the owner of the missing item.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding a matching request is easier when lost item has unique identifier (eg. PAN Card), 
			but in other cases (eg. Folder), it becomes very difficult. But with us, you can be sure to loose nothing in future.
			<br> 
			All you need to do is to create your own 'Lost and Found Id' and add a visible note to all of your belongings which would say: 
			<br><br>			
			<font color="green"><I>If you find me, please report it on "http://lostandfound.report/found=YOUR_ID"</I></font>
			<br><br>
			Click here to create your 'Lost and Found Id'.
